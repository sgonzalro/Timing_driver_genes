# Timing_driver_genes
Timing analysis of most recurrent driver genes as a contribution to PCAWG-11


## Input files

The script needs 4 files to be run:

- TableS2_driver_point_mutations: File not privided but can be obtained from PCAWG

## Analysis workflow
```
load("TableS2_driver_point_mutations_annotation.RData")  #or equivalent read.table to TableS2_driver_point_mutations generated by PCAWG
CANCERGENES <- levels(finalDrivers$ID)

finalGenotypes <- Genotypes(path_snv_timing_VCFs, path_indel_timing_VCFs) ## both files can be obtained running [MutationTimeR](https://github.com/gerstung-lab/MutationTimeR)

purity_ploidy <- read.table(purity_ploidy_file, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
load("2017_02_Patients_tissue_colors.Rdata", verbose = TRUE) #sample2donor, specimenData and tissueColors files

odds_top50 <- timing_drivers(finalGenotypes, purity_ploidy, tissueColors, sample2donor, specimenData, 50)
odds_tp53 <- timing_tp53(finalGenotypes, purity_ploidy, tissueColors, sample2donor, specimenData, odds_top50[["count_genes"]])
save(list(odds_top50 = odds_top50, odds_tp53 = odds_tp53), file = "aux_final_results.RData")
```
